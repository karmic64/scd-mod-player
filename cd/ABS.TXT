You should be careful about people like this I got a bad feeling about this thread every time I see it I don't trust the people who post and it one didn't I've never listen to the music there in

It just doesn't seem like they're doing a lot of Renditions of popular music is all just silly zany Sonic music over and over it seems is all I'm saying

I'm just saying you want to look back of your childhood and see your rendition of Sonic Sonic the zany fast hedgehog or do you want to see yourself singing The Cure by Lady Gaga
